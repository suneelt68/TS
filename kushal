Or, you might feel and wonder why your mood is changing so much, or that you feel bloated and suffer stomach cramps. This is because of pregnancy hormones. At this point it is too early to see a reliable result on your pregnancy test. You may notice some bleeding or ‘spotting’ - small quantities of light pink, light red or light brown blood. This is not your period and don’t worry about the bleeding. It is not a sign that something is wrong.",
